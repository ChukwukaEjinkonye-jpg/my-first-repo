# my-first-repo
My family and I are immigrants coming in from Nigeria after several years of living from place to place we set up a permenant residence in Coney Island, Brooklyn. 
Before Marcy Labs, I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and studied in Rochester Institute of Technology for two years. Lately, I've been practicing my combos in Devil May Cry 5. It's very difficult to grasp but I stick with it since I think it's fun.
